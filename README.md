# Thin-Section-Porosity
Calculates the total porosity of a thin section and a histogram of pore sizes.
Thin Sections are 30 micron slices of rock used in Geology to describe the minerals present in the rock sample. In petroleum geology, calculating the porosity of a rock sample is important and is part of the routine geological analysis. During the preparation of the Thin Section, pores are filled with a blue resin that when photographed in a microscope, allows you to differentiate the pores from the rest of the minerals.
You have to select four images with the same resolution, usually from diferent zones of the Thin Section, then modify the HSV color limits to threshold the blue zones that represent the Thin Section porosity.
Once the blue zones of the porosity are detected, press Calculate to get a report file that includes the calculation of the Total Porosity and a Histogram of the percentage of the porosity represented by the different pore sizes.
Pore Size Diameter is calculated as the diameter of a circle that has the same area as the total area of the pore.
